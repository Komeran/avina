THE VOID

This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the GM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is Incapacitated. A Wish spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it.
You draw no more cards.
